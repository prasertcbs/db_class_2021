# Group Project Guidelines for Database Application Management (2602446) 2564 Term 1 

*The group project guidelines are subject to change, as needed, to best
realize the educational goals of the course. Necessary changes will be
announced in class or on course materials with fair prior notice.*

For this project, students are to select one organization, design a
database to support its business processes, generate test data, address
important business-related questions, and provide recommendations as to
how such an organization could manage and/or improve its business.

Students should be able to easily obtain information about the
organization through reading materials or online. Students are also able
to witness the organization's efforts first-hand, and are welcome to
include such observations in their report.

Students have the option to work either individually or in groups of up
to four members, and will be able to choose their own groups.

The project is worth **20% of the final course grade**.

## Submission
Notbook documents together with database files and presentation clips
are due Sunday, November 14, 2021 at 11:59 PM, and are to be submitted
on Google Classroom. Only one student from each group will be required
to submit the group's project.

Every student must critique another group's project. Instructions for
critique submission will be forthcoming on Google Classroom.

**Late submissions will not be accepted. Students will receive a grade
of zero for anything submitted after the due date** unless academic
concession has been granted.

## Project Guidelines and Structure
Submit one notebook document and database file only.
The cover page includes course number, assignment title, date, student
names, and student numbers.
>Only APA citation style is accepted.
The notebook must include:
-   an executive summary;
-   background information on the organization;
-   database design and explanation;
-   an analysis of current business practices, including 10
    business-related questions, SQL statements, result tables, and
    recommendations as to how the organization could manage and/or
    improve its business;

Supplementary materials must include the database file, including
ER-Diagram and test data.

## Presentation guidelines
The presentation clip must last 5 minutes and be shared with the class.
Submit one presentation clip (e.g., MP4, MOV).

## Project Critique Guidelines
Students must review and post one response to the project of another
group.

When students reply, students should choose a project that does not have
any replies yet (unless they all have replied already).

In the reply, students should give constructive criticism and focus on
how to improve the database design.

All project responses will be shared with the class.
